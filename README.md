## ⚙️ Final Project  
In the future there will be information about our final project for the course.

## 🔬 Labs  
Throughout the semester we had different lab assignments. The labs focus on understanding how AI techniques, accelerated pipelines, and modern data workflows are applied in real cybersecurity scenarios.  
We work with real threat reports, security logs, network data, and NLP-based threat examples, gradually building practical skills needed in SOC, CTI, and AI-driven detection environments.
